# Stack Overkill

# Demo

The site is live and functional [here](https://overkill.freeciv.life)

# Idea

An anonymous Q&A site helps when playing long term strategy games because, while we have a whatsapp group, asking a question about game mechanics can be interpreted as a sign of weakness and be tactically unwise.

#Evaluation

This was a bit of an experiment for me in using flask, postgresql and bootstrap. I think I would just use my own CSS now that I know more about it, rather than bootstrap. Also, I would have dealt with the 'likes' by using javascript, rather than server side. The pages implement the Open Graph Protocol, which was interesting to learn about.

I think at larger scale, the anonymous nature would be unreasonable due to trolling, but with a maximum of 12 users who share a common purpose, it works quite well!
